VERSION 3 OF RIP PROGRAM (release 3-1)
(updated December 5, 2001)

This is the main directory of RIP program in MM5 modeling system
Version 3. Everything a user needs to run the RIP program, except
for NCAR Graphics libraries, is contained in this directory.

RIP, like GRAPH, requires NCAR Graphics to run. NCAR Graphics is
a licensed software, but part of it has become free. RIP only
requires this part of the NCAR Graphics to run.  For information
on NCAR Graphics, please visit

    http://ngwww.ucar.edu/info/pricing.html

This version of RIP may be run on Cray, unix workstations, and PC
running Linux.

All fortran source code is located in directory src/.

For bug fixes, please read file CHANGES.  For actual diff files,
please see directory Diff.

For questions, please send emails to mesouser@ucar.edu

What is in V3 RIP?

RIP is plotting program developed by Dr. Mark Stoelinga at
University of Washington. It may be used to plot V3 pressure
level data, and V1/V2 and V3 sigma level data.

-----------------------------------------------------

RIP documentation:

The document "A Users' Guide to RIP Version 3", by Mark
Stoelinga, is a comprenesive guide to all aspects of RIP Version
3, including set-up (compilation, etc.), data pre-processing with
the program RIPDP, and the use of RIP itself.  The User's Guide
is written in HTML format, and can be found in the RIP tar file
in Doc/ripug.html.  It can also be accessed on the web from the
MM5 Web Site, http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/ripug.html.

IBM operation note:

When running on an IBM SP2, if the namelist in rip.in
is in the default format of beginning and ending 
with a "&", then an environment variable must be
set to recognize this.  The command is:

        setenv XLFRTEOPTS "namelist=old"

.  If one desires to run on the IBM without setting 
this variable, the namelist delimiters must be modified 
to begin with "&" and end with "/".
